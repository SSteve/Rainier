# Renamed to Rainier

Rainier is heavily inspired by UserLand Frontier, but is *not* Frontier.

However, at first we were calling it Frontier. When we renamed it to Rainier, we moved all the existing source and resources into this folder.

The contents of this folder will probably all get deleted, piecemeal, over time.
