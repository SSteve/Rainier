# Script Docs

Documentation can be generated for any script by use of comments at or near the top.

First line tells what the script does.

A line that starts with `Parameters: ` describes the parameters.

A line that starts with `Returns: ` describes what it returns.

A line that starts with `Errors: ` describes possible errors that may be thrown.

A line that starts with `Notes: ` includes extra notes.

A line that starts with `Examples: ` shows example use.

A line that starts with `Changes: ` lists change notes.

A script may have one, some, all, or none of the above. The app may use this information to generate documentation in various formats. They might appear in a popover, for instance, or in a detail view when viewing standard-library verbs.
