# Original Frontier

This is my fork of the <a href="http://frontierkernel.org/">Frontier kernel</a>.

The point of this fork isn’t to develop it, but to delete as much as possible so I can see what needs to be done in the modern version.

The other point is so that I can build and run it, and make sure the new version is compatible with this old version.

I’m building this using Xcode 3.2.6 running on OS X 10.6.8 Server in VMWare. I’ve heard that it’s possible to build using a newer Xcode on a newer OS, but I haven’t tried. At this point I’m not sure I need to.
